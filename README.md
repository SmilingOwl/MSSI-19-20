## Optimization of surgery allocation to operating rooms in a post-pandemic context

### Abstract
The return to normal after a general close down of services such as surgeries is characterized by a large number of surgeries that were put on-hold and that need to be scheduled. It is critical to optimize the allocation of surgeries to operating rooms, reducing the average waiting time and possible casualties. In this study, different policies of allocation of operating rooms to surgeries in a hospital will be discussed.

This project has the aim of optimizing the allocation of surgeries to operating rooms and with the more specific goal of minimizing the waiting time for surgery, providing information about different heuristics that can be used in this process.
